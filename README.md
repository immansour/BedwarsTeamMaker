# BedwarsTeamMaker

The only file you need to change is igns.txt. Put all the igns you need in that one file.
Go to hypixel run /api new and copy and paste that code where it says place key here.

Run through python. 

To stat check do getData(username)

for example getData("Chesshobo") or getData("Grindey")

To make the teams based on the igns simply do maketeam()
